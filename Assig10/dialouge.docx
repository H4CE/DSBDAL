I know you are an Army doctor, and you have been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you have got a brother who is worried about you, but you won't go to him for help because you don not approve of him, possibly because he is an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his wife, and I know your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic - quite correctly, I'm afraid. That's enough to be going on with, don't you think? The name's Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221-B Baker Street. Afternoon.
